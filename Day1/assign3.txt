Assignment-3,Day-1:
JavaScript Datatytpe:
    There are two types of datatypes in JS:
    1. Primitive datatypes - It consists of a number, string, boolean, null, undefined and bigInt. The primitive datatypes are stored in the memory location on the stack. It can hold only one value.
    2. Reference datatypes - It consists of a function, array and an object. The reference datatypes are stored in memory location on the heap. It can hold multiple values. 

    Primitive datatypes:

    1. number
        syntax var x = 1;
        It holds a single value.

    2. string
        syntax var name = 'Tim';
        This can also be done also by doing double inverted comma's, 
        var name = "Tim";
        It consists of a string.

    3.boolean
        syntax var canfly = 'false';
                var canread = 'true';
        It consists of boolean values like true or false. When we compare two values we get result in terms of boolean values that is true/false.

    4. null 
        syntax var y = 'null';

    5. undefined
        syntax var z;
        this can also be done,
        var z = 'undefined';

    6. bigInt
        syntax var no = '34567784n';
        The bigInt stores values greater than [(2^53)-1].

    Reference datatypes:

    1. Function
        a. syntax function function_name (parameters)
                  {
                    // consists of code to be executed;
                  }  
        b. Function is block of code that can be executed n no of times.
            for eg1: function myfunction()
                     {
                        console.log("Hi");   
                     }
                Here, the function is not returning any value.

                eg2: function myfunction(a,b)
                     {
                        return a*b;
                     }
                Here, parameters are passed and the function is returning a value.

        c. The functions are not executed immediately after they are written,   they are stored for further use and are executed later, when they are called upon.
        d. Function expressions can be stored in the in the varriable also,
        for eg: var x = function myfunction(a,b){ return a*b };
        e. After a function is stored in the varriable, the variable can be used as a function. 
        for eg: var x = function ( a, b ){ return a*b };
                z = x( 4, 3 );
            Note: Functions stored in the variables do not need function names. They are always called by the variable names.  
        
    2. Array: 
        a. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
            syntax:
            One way a array can be decalred: 
            var color = [ 'red', 'blue', 'green' ];

            Second way a array can be decalred:
            var color = [
                'red',
                'blue',
                'green'
            ];        

        b. Array elements are accessed by array index which starts from 0.
        for eg:
            var color = [ 'red', 'blue', 'green' ];
            var color1 = color[0];

    3. Object: 
        a. Objects are variables but they can store multiple values.
            syntax:
            var object_name = {name1:'value1', name2:'value2',......}
            One way is:
            var emplyoee = { name:'Rahul', age:45, city:'Nashik'};

            Second way is:
            var emplyoee = {
                name:'Rakesh',
                age:34,
                city:'Nagpur'
            };

        b. Object elements are accessed by:
            object_name.property_name;
            or 
            object_name[ property_name ];

            for eg: var emplyoee = { name:'Rahul', age:45, city:'Nashik'};
            var age = emplyoee.age;
            or
            var name = emplyoee[ name ];
